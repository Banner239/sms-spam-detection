Data

The dataset used for training and testing the model is available in the data directory. It includes labeled SMS messages, specifying whether each message is spam or non-spam. Feel free to explore and preprocess the data to suit your needs.

Deep Learning Model

The project employs a deep learning model, typically using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, to effectively capture the sequential patterns and nuances of natural language. The model is trained on the labeled SMS dataset to learn the distinguishing features of spam and non-spam messages.
Results

The project showcases the performance of the deep learning model, providing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Visualizations and confusion matrices may be included to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the model's effectiveness.
